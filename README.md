# SolutionHub
 
An organization level freelancing website. For example, in the SolutionHub page for NITP students can post various jobs or tasks, and other people can bid for that job.

The jobs can include things like solving a doubt, debugging a project, help with some topic or chapter, editing a video, cultural events execution. Basically any volunteer/paid work. Faculties can also use this platform to get trivial work done. Like copy correction, data collection, making a presentation, research review, conducting polls, etc. All the work needs not to be paid. There will be an option to put up a volunteer job. 

The person who will put up the job can have conversations with bidders and can prepare a questioner, then only make his/her decesion.
